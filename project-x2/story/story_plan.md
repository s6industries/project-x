an Ark is a mini-soular system


(a origin story of cosmic polka dots)


CHAPTER: VOID

All white. Peaceful. Slient.
Pulsing chromatic waves across the white plane. 
A note emerges, a single frequency 

1 small black dot emerges center screen, popping in with bounce. 
the 1 dot splits into 2 dots, vertically aligned. 
The 2 dots start to spin around each other creating trails.

dots split into more dots, swirling and spinning chaotically until they form patterns
then the pattern of a circle is discovered
then all the small black dots attune to the circle patthen, growing into circles with thin black lines.

(Dark divides the light. Negative defines the positive.)


CHAPTER: CHROMA

Within the small white circles, the chromatic pulsing continues at different frequencies. The growing variety of frequencies sounds like cosmic wind chimes. 
Then within the small circle, ortongoanl lines like a diamond/cube extend from the edges into the center.
The cricle is now subdivided into a lattice, geometric shards. 

the black lines divding the shards thickens, further separating the shards.
The larger containing circle begins to expand/contract, pulsing with the rhythm of the universal white plane.


CHAPTER: MATRIX

as the pulsing increases within the matrtix, the fragments are shaken from their alignment, now freely floating in the negative space.
AS they float, the shards shrink into small polygons/cubes like crystals. 
As each shard shrinks into its center, it also grows a circle expanding from its center. 
The former shard, now as a small chromatic crystal, is embedded within the local circle that is a solid color.
(this chromatic polygon embedded within a sphere = "protosoul")

That circle cycles through solid colors at a slower frequency than the universal canvas. 
Zoom out to see all the litte solid circles within the bigger circle, quickly blinking colors, and bouncing around among each other

so all the white has transformed into many small chromatic circles, like cells multiplied

(the trees and the bees)


CHAPTER: SOLUS
(protosoul type A - the trees)
(formation of the solar system)

zoom in on one chromatic cell matrix.
The cells of the matrix morph from various polygons to circles.
The larger circles absorb its neighbor little circles and gather the rest around them.

The large circles absorb little ones until they burst into a chromatic halo, radiating chromatics lines and waves
the swirling cloud of little circles not absorbed gather into their own spheres of little polka dots, 
the little spheres/dot clusters do not emit the large chromatic aura like their larger bretheren, but they do continue mixing around the smaller dots they contain in varying patters/rates
some small speheres do have such exquisite dot mixing that they eventually ignite a tighter chromatic aura on their surface (flowering planets)


CHAPTER: ARK
(protosoul type B - the bees)
(formation of interdimensional pollinators)
meanwhile as the solar systems form, some protosouls are affected by the gravity of the large circles (Solara). 
But with more dots gathered into the Solaria, that opens up more space for the non-gravity protosouls (Arkana) to float and define a different relationship among each other
The arkana like pollinators, roam about the negative space between well-formed solara, searching for those smaller chroma-emitting spheres
arkana create different attraction/anti-graviational patterns around them
one formation is an "ark" in which 1 arkana is the center node and 4 or more others form a prism encapsulating it.
an Ark is a forager visiting the small chromasphere, accepting the gravity of planet just enough to dock with it.
the docked ark then sends down a "proboscis" as incarnations of its will to extract chromatic "experience"
and while docked it also gives to/mutates the planet, as the remnants of each incarnation enhance the exquisite dot mixing

the ark docked with planet is a hybrid life form


CHAPTER: HIVE

after an ark has filled itself with experience, it detaches from the planet and floats away
each experience (each incarnation lifetime) is a face of the prism encircling the core arkana
each prism face is arranged so that the core arkana can ignite a "magnetically contained fusion reaction"
solving this prismatic/experiential alignment creates enormous chromatic energy, allowing the arkana to radiate with more exquisiteness
arks of varying prismatic alignments and radiation levels meet to share their unique discoveries/treasures
arkana inspire each other to dock with planets, explore relationships with solara and each other


CHAPTER: HOME

as arkana solve increasingly complex prismatic alignments, they add more faces to their prism 
so their polyhedral complexity approaches a sphere
the most spherical, radiant arks approach the edge of the greater negative space in which they were birthed
when they reach spherical perfection, they cross over the boundary between negative space and the original chromatic canvas
more negative space within the cosmic sphere is filled with perfectly crystallized, chromatic arkana pusling their gradients in harmony
